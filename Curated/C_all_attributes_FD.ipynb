MVE Delivery Technology encapsulates ceramides in the formula to ensure efficient delivery within the skin?s barrier and slow hydration release over time. This non-comedogenic facial wash is an effective yet non-irritating way to start off any skincare regimen. Best for normal to dry skin and daily use on face.</td>\n",

Face cleansers can remove dirt, makeup and other debris, but a hydrating face wash cleanser, like CeraVe(R) Hydrating Facial Cleanser, can do all that without disrupting the skin?s natural protective barrier or stripping the skin of its natural moisture. MVE Delivery Technology encapsulates ceramides in the formula to ensure efficient delivery within the skin?s barrier and slow hydration release over time. This non-comedogenic facial wash is an effective yet non-irritating way to start off any skincare regimen. Best for normal to dry skin and daily use on face.   \n",
